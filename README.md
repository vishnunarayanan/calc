The calculator should support the basic binary 

arithmetic operators of addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).  The
calculator should read expressions in prefix notation with parentheses and return the result.

For example, to add the numbers 2 and 3, you would use the expression:

    (+ 2 3)
    
which would yield a result of 5.  Expressions can be nested to perform complex calculations.  For example:

    (* (+ 2 3) (- 10 6))

reduces to

    (* 5 4)
    
which results in 20.

If you wanted to add the numbers 1 through 5, you could type:

    (+ 1 (+ 2 (+ 3 (+ 4 5))))

Your program should accept integers and decimals.
